# Library-System-in-JAVA
A Computer System for the management of a Library
This Library Management project aims to design an information system to help manage the Library and more specifically, to help manage members, manage loans, reservations and returns of books.
The software, which will follow this analysis, should therefore make it possible to:
• manage the people registered - or wishing to register - at the library,
• manage book loan, return and recall.
• as well as reservations by registered persons.
